Views.py is code for handling how the backend should interact with different
pices of the front end. Right now it contains several different POST and GET
functions that deal with our databases and HTML code:

get_fields_content
   # This returns different information about a product

get_product_category
   # Specfically looks for the category that a product falls under

get_all_product
   # Finds all products in the database

add_account
   # Allows a new user to open an account, and adds them to
     a database of users

get_all_account
    # Finds all registered users 

add_order
   # Creates a new product object and adds it to the database,
     this allows for items to be created for the marketplace

These are the current methods our backend is capable of running.
Using this users can not only eventually log onto our site, but
can upload items to sell that can be displayed on our main page
